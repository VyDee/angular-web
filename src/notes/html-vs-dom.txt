DOM 
    -- stands for Document Object Model. When a browser loads a web
    page, the browser creates a DOM of that page
    -- DOM contains the HTML elements as objects, their properties, 
    methods and events and it is a standard for accessing, modifying,
    adding or deleting HTML elements

HTML attribute vs DOM property
    -- Attribites are defined by HTML, where as properties are defined
    by the DOM
    -- Attribites initialize DOM properties. Once the initilization
    complete, the Attribites job is done
    -- Property values can change, where as attribute value can't

Important Points
    -- HTML attributes and the DOM properties are different things
    -- Angular binding works with properties and events, and not attributes

        For example:
        <button [disabled]='isDisabled'></button>
        -->> disabled is DOM property, and not attribute
