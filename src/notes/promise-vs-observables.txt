Promises
    Represent a single value in the future 
    Asynchronous
    Not lazy
    Cannot be cancelled

Observables
    Represent 0 or more values now or in the future 
    Synchronous or Asynchronous
    Lazy. An observable is not callled until we subscribe to the Observable
    Can be cancelled by using the unsubscribe() method
    Array of data that contains any values that change over time
    We can manipulate the data using "map" 

    Other features:
        Can be Synchronous
        Improve Error Handling
        Can be closed independently of returning a value
        Can deal with time
        Observable provides operators like map, forEach, filter, reduce,
            retryWhen, etc.
