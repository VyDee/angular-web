RxJS - map vs tap

  map and tap are both RxJS operators.

  Both of them are pipeable operators which takes input as
  Observables, perform some action and return an output
  observable.

  >>> map
    -- A mapping function takes a thing and returns another
    thing.
    -- For ex: I can vuild a function that takes 10 , modifies
    by adding 1 and returns 11
    -- Array#map applies such mapping function to all elements
    of an array but "map" doesn't mean "iteration"
    -- The map operator will simply apply a function to that
    data and return the result

  >>> tap
    -- The tap operator takes a data, applies a function to
    that data but returns the original data, if the function
    bothered to return a result, tap just ignores it
    -- For ex: I can vuild a function that takes 10 , modifies
    by adding 1 and returns the same number 10 (not 11)
