Quick register note

    As we need to use Authenticated service (auth.service.ts) throughout our module, we can register it in the 
    app module (app.module.ts) and use it everywhere throughout the app. However, this can only apply to "providers"
    
    For imports and declarations for a certain module, you need to define them all in each module
